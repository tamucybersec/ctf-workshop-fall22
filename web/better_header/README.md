# Better Header

## Description
Can you find the flag by visiting the site?

## Solution

From the name my immediate assumption is that there is something in the headers and this is supported by "Everything you need is here", the text received when opening up the page. I could have checked the source for completions sake but didn't need to as the flag was just chillin in the flag header which I read using firefox dev tools

`gigem{f0undH3ad3rFl4g}`

## Developer Notes
Run `make` to start up the container on port 80. For cleanup, run `make stop`.
